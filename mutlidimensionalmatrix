-> i have to create matrix in which I have to take the numb for the user that what would be the size of the matrix and also the input must be in the way that 
-> in first row of the matrix should have the value in which power must be the 1 and in second value the power for the whole row must of the power of 2
-> and so on as size of the matrix grows.

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please Enter the Size of Matrix");
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int[][] arr=new int[n][n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n;j++){
                
                 arr[i][j]=(int)Math.pow(i+2,j+1);
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n;j++){
                System.out.print(arr[i][j]+" ");
            }
            System.out.println("");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
